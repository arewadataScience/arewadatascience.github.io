    "text": "ArewaDS-LMBF, a team from the Arewa Data Science Fellowship, achieved an impressive feat on May 13th, 2023, by securing second place in the Cohere AI hackathon. Organized by Cohere and AI Saturdays Lagos, the hackathon centered around the theme “Empower your creativity with Cohere’s Multilingual Embeddings” and was hosted on devpost. The event spanned from May 1st to May 7th, 2023, with participants gathering at multiple locations across the continent, including the enthusiastic Arewa Data Science Academy community.\nThe teams representing ArewaDS showcased their expertise in machine learning, particularly in large language models, as they presented their innovative projects utilizing the Cohere multilingual embeddings API. Among the submissions, ArewaDS-LMBF proposed an exceptional solution that utilised the multilingual embeddings API to align Hausa sentences with their potential translations in English. This approach aimed to contribute to the creation of accurate parallel datasets for machine translation. Their outstanding submission propelled them to the finals, securing them a well-deserved second place in the overall rankings.\nLukman, the team lead of ArewaDS-LMBF, expressed his overwhelming delight at this historic achievement. He remarked, “Starting from scratch in machine learning and winning an AI hackathon within a few months of joining the fellowship is truly incredible. The unwavering support of the mentors in Arewa Data Science Academy played a pivotal role in this accomplishment. They ensured equal opportunities for all fellows and guided us to the right resources. I am immensely grateful for this invaluable experience.”\nAs a reward for their outstanding performance, the team was granted a prize of 800 US Dollars, along with 2000 Cohere API credits, to be shared among the five team members. Looking ahead, the team revealed their plans to further enhance their solution while harnessing the cohere platform to deepen their understanding of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Their commitment to continuous improvement and exploration exemplifies their dedication to excellence.\nThis accomplishment offers a mere glimpse into the transformative impact that the Arewa Data Science Fellowship has had on the lives of its young fellows within a short span of time. The Arewa Data Science Fellowship stands as an intensive program designed to nurture the next generation of research-oriented data scientists. Through its mentorship, monthly stipends, and provision of data, the fellowship equips aspiring data scientists with the necessary tools to thrive in their field.

Blogging not only allowed me to reflect on my progress but also reinforced my understanding of the concepts I was learning, solidifying my grasp on data science principles.\nThroughout this transformative journey, our mentors played an indispensable role. Their immense talent and dedication created a supportive and encouraging environment for us to thrive. Regular updates and organization through platforms like Notion, slack and telegram ensured we never missed any valuable insights, keeping us on track and motivated.\nBeyond technical skills, the fellowship also emphasized essential aspects of professional development, including crafting an impressive CV. With practical exercises using LaTeX, we learned to create captivating CVs that effectively showcased our capabilities. The mentors’ commitment to providing personalized feedback and constructive criticism proved invaluable in refining our CVs to perfection, preparing us for future career opportunities.\nThe Arewa Data Science Academy has been an absolute blessing, propelling me beyond the boundaries of my imagination. As a part of this prestigious fellowship, I have gained newfound confidence and a fervor for continuous learning. My technical repertoire has expanded, and I have developed a deeper sense of self-awareness and determination to succeed in the data science field.\nReflecting on my journey as a fellow, I am amazed by how much I have achieved in such a short time. The skills and knowledge I have acquired will undoubtedly pave the way for a bright future in data science, and I am eager to explore the limitless possibilities that lie ahead. The academy has laid a strong foundation for my ongoing pursuit of excellence, inspiring me to keep pushing my boundaries and seeking new challenges.\nIn conclusion, joining the Arewa Data Science Academy fellowship has been a pivotal moment in my life. It has equipped me with a diverse set of skills, provided a supportive network, and instilled an unwavering passion for continuous growth. I am profoundly grateful for this transformative experience and eagerly anticipate the boundless opportunities that await me on this remarkable path of learning and discovery."

    "text": "Arewa Data Science Fellowship\nWelcome to Arewa Data Science Academy! We are a community of educators, learners and data science enthusiasts with a passion for empowering marginalized students to reach their full potential.\nOur mission is to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of data science. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools and resources they need to pursue their dreams, regardless of their background or circumstances.\nTo achieve this mission, we offer a wide range of programs and services to students from all over Nigeria. Our student mentoring programs provide personalized support and guidance to help students succeed in their studies. We also offer seminars and workshops on data science, machine learning and related fields to university students, to help them stay current with the latest advancements in the field.\nOne of the core focus of our academy is free training to affected marginalized students, we hold weekend training sessions and this year we are thrilled to announce that these training will be more structured and streamlined than ever before, thanks to the sponsorship of Google Research, TensorFlow and HausaNLP and Bayero University Kano. We are particularly focusing on underrepresented groups such as Women and Students from Arewa and communities affected by insecurity as part of our efforts to bridge the gap and bring equal opportunities to all.\nWe invite you to join our community and be a part of our mission to empower marginalized students and build a more equitable future. Thank you for considering Arewa Data Science Academy!"

    "text": "Second Cohort of Machine Learning Fellowship\nWe are thrilled to announce that 81 dedicated learners have been chosen for the second cohort of the Arewa Data Science Fellowship - a prestigious four-month program focusing on machine learning. Throughout the fellowship, fellows are immersed in an intensive data science curriculum anchored on real-world projects and guided mentorship. The objective extends beyond mere knowledge acquisition, as they are also educated about the nuances of research and broader learning.\n\nGender: Out of the total, 67 fellows are male, and 14 are female.\nEducation: The majority are Bachelor’s degree holders, with some pursuing or holding Master’s or PhD degrees.\nGeographic Spread: Fellows hail from various states across our nation, and some are even currently based abroad.\nAlma Mater Spotlight: The top three universities from which our fellows have graduated or currently studying in are Bayero University Kano (BUK), Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) in Zaria, and Yusuf Maitama Sule University in Kano.\nTech Skills: Approximately 45% of the fellows have experience with the Python programming language, while a segment of them are newcomers to programming. We believe that this fellowship will serve as a stepping stone for these bright minds, enabling them to evolve into pioneers and researchers in the data science domain."
