## Biography
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Northeastern University’s Institute for Experiential AI, where I lead research at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science. My work focuses on addressing linguistic and cultural disparities in AI systems, particularly for low-resource languages. I have developed foundational resources, including [AfriHate](https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate) and [ArtElingo-28](https://www.artelingo.org/artelingo-28-emnlp24). My recent projects focus on the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs). I also organized SemEval shared tasks.

I co-founded [HausaNLP](https://hausanlp.github.io) and [Arewa Data Science](https://arewadatascience.github.io), initiatives that enable me to collaborate with researchers and practitioners to advance NLP and data science for low-resource languages. Prior to joining Northeastern, I served as an Assistant Professor at Bayero University Kano, where I taught courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and database systems, and mentored graduate students on research projects. During my PhD at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, I proposed predictive models for movie revenue prediction using social media data.

My work has been supported by over $400,000 in competitive grants from Google Research, Lacuna Fund, and Oracle. One of my papers was also selected as the Best Paper in the ACII 2025 conference, and another received Honorable Mention for Best Paper in SemEval 2024, as part of Shared Task I co-organized.
