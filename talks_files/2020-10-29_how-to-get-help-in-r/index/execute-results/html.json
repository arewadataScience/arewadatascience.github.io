In the session, Ella will talk us through different ways to get help when you get stuck on a problem in R. We’ll cover how and where to look for answers and how to ask and post good questions that make it easy for others to help you, including a demo of the excellent `reprex` and `datapasta` packages. So whether you’re an R novice or more experienced R user, hopefully there’ll be some useful tips for you!\n\n## Event details\n\n**Event:** [R Ladies Coventry](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-coventry/events/273429872/) (the inaugural talk)\n\n**Date:** October 29th, 2020 \n\n**Location:** Zoom\n\nI gave a very slightly updated version of the talk again three months later:\n\n**Event**: [bseeR](https://www.ellenwebborn.com/rusergroup/)\n\n**Date:** January 28th, 2021\n\n**Location:** Microsoft Teams\n\n## Key points\n\n- When faced with a question/problem, have a good look for an answer in R itself and/or online\n\n- Don't be shy about asking questions!\n\n- Write reproducible examples, best with the {reprex} package\n\n- Give thought to where you ask/post your question\n\n- Give back by helping others\n\n\n## Slides\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck ar4x3\" src=\"https://ellakaye.github.io/Rladies-Coventry-getting-help-in-R/getting_help_in_R.html#1\" title=\"Getting Help in R slides\">\n</iframe>\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for slideshow (once you've clicked inside it):\n\n- Use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to navigate through the slides.\n\n- Use <kbd>o</kbd> for an overview of all slides.\n\n- Use <kbd>h</kbd> to see a list of other shortcuts \n  \n  - <kbd>f</kbd> to toggle full screen not working, but the rest are fine.\n  \n  - For full screen slides, go to [slides](https://ellakaye.github.io/Rladies-Coventry-getting-help-in-R/getting_help_in_R.html) then press <kbd>f</kbd>.",
