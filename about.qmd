# [Arewa Data Science Fellowship]{.third-color}

Welcome to Arewa Data Science Academy! We are a community of educators, learners and data science enthusiasts with a passion for empowering marginalized students to reach their full potential.

Our mission is to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of data science. We believe that everyone should have access to the tools and resources they need to pursue their dreams, regardless of their background or circumstances.

To achieve this mission, we offer a wide range of programs and services to students from all over Nigeria. Our student mentoring programs provide personalized support and guidance to help students succeed in their studies. We also offer seminars and workshops on data science, machine learning and related fields to university students, to help them stay current with the latest advancements in the field.

One of the core focus of our academy is free training to affected marginalized students, we hold weekend training sessions and this year we are thrilled to announce that these training will be more structured and streamlined than ever before, thanks to the sponsorship of Google Research, TensorFlow and HausaNLP and Bayero University Kano. We are particularly focusing on underrepresented groups such as Women and Students from Arewa and communities affected by insecurity as part of our efforts to bridge the gap and bring equal opportunities to all.

We invite you to join our community and be a part of our mission to empower marginalized students and build a more equitable future. Thank you for considering Arewa Data Science Academy! <!--
